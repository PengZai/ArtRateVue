0,1,Bodynest交互式居家健身可穿戴设备,胡杰,交通工具,中国,"Under the influence of the epidemic, people spend less time outside, and they spend more time at home, which disrupts our original life. Less outdoor exercise results in less physical function. Many people are starting to exercise at home. At the same time, with the development of the Internet and the popularity of online live broadcasting, more and more people learn fitness through online learning and carry out fitness activities at home.
The rapid increase in the number of people working out has also naturally increased the chances of problems such as dizziness, arrhythmia and muscle damage due to lack of preparation, post-exercise stretching or the choice of an unsuitable intensity.
Through the combination of hardware and software, the program cleverly combines the process of fitness exercise with fitness protection, which ensures the safety of users during exercise to the greatest extent and avoids sports injury while users exercise scientifically. This scheme has designed three different protective tools, such as protective gloves, waist protection and knee protection, which cooperate with each other and are independent of each other.
Because kneepad, waist, and protective gloves are suitable for different sports. They can also detect the movement data of different parts. Therefore, while retaining the protective function of these protective devices, we can realize the correction of fitness knowledge through the analysis of a large amount of movement knowledge, which can avoid the possibility of injury to a large extent.
The shape and structure design of the scheme refer to the structure of castor cocoons. The semi-hollow structure solves the sweltering and binding feeling of traditional gloves and retains strong protective materials in areas with high probability of impact and injury. Through the collocation of a variety of materials, it makes the acquisition of a soft and comfortable feeling and a certain sense of science and technology. At the same time, the use of castor cocoon texture and protective combination, so that its texture has a certain characteristics and curve beauty.
Add the protective equipment we need to the connection with mobile devices by adding connected devices. When the user is doing various movements, the following alerts will be sent in front of the phone when the fitness protector detects excessive pressure and potential danger. The indicator light also turns red. The software also provides physical stress and injury analysis of recent sports. At the same time, the image of virtual human was introduced into the front design. Enhance the affinity of meeting, while allowing users to have a more intuitive experience.
The balance between ""fitness"" and ""safety"" and ""entertainment"" is highly bound. What this plan does is to lower the barrier of fitness and the possibility of injury, and make fitness really popular. In recent years, the caller platform gradually sinks, fitness can also.
Home fitness is just one entry point, and there may be many. In order to weaken the professionalism of fitness sports, reduce the possibility of injury, and enhance its fitness and entertainment functions, only the improvement of entertainment and safety can improve the acceptance of the public. To help users build a healthy body.",73.0,52.0,60.0,64.0,52.0,"[{'path': '1/1.jpeg'}, {'path': '1/1.png'}, {'path': '1/2.jpeg'}, {'path': '1/2.png'}, {'path': '1/3.png'}, {'path': '1/画板_1_拷贝.jpg'}, {'path': '1/画板_1.jpg'}]"

Designer: Ma Chengxie， shenzhen University
This design provides a travel assistance system for visually impaired people, including a personal wearable device and a mobile app, which are interconnected with the smart bus system to solve the problems of visually impaired users in the bus travel scene, improve the travel experience, and enable visually impaired people to travel independently.

The hardware part of this design is a wearable navigation glove equipped with a TOF module and three vibration modules. The TOF module is used to sense and identify the surrounding environment information, while the vibration module is used to feedback on different information. Through the differentiation of the three modules, it can remind users to avoid obstacles, guide users to get on and off buses, and transmit steering information.

The mobile terminal bus App ""BeepBeep Bus"" designed in this paper can help users to book buses in advance, conduct real-time navigation, and remind the driver to pick up when the user arrives at the bus station. In addition, users can also adjust the wearable device through the App, set the reminder mode in advance, and turn on the photosensitive sensor light to attract the attention of passers-by in the condition of insufficient light, so as to avoid collisions and misunderstandings.

Before a trip, users can check bus routes and transfer conditions in advance through the "" BeepBeep Bus ""App, book all bus trips in advance, and add common trips for quick follow-up booking. On the way to the bus station, the user can avoid obstacles with the help of navigation gloves, accurately turn and safely arrive at the bus station. Users can send one-click reminders to bus drivers through the App when waiting the bus, so that the drivers can understand the needs of visually impaired people. When the bus arrives at the station, the user's navigation gloves can receive signals from the sensors on the target bus, quickly find the correct shift and boarding position, and avoid getting on the wrong bus. During the ride, the navigation system can send out a reminder of getting off in advance to avoid missed stops.

This design considering the users’ difficulties in the bus trip and solve them by the design of MVP（minimum viable product）, at the same time, considering the connection between the user and the stakeholders for the design of some interpersonal interaction to meet the more perceptual experience. In addition, the design also has room for further expansion. At present, it considers the situation of bus trip, and the functions of wearable devices are relatively basic. They can be further combined with other complex systems, such as supermarket shopping system, air and railway remote travel system, scenic area navigation system, etc. It will bring more convenience for the visually impaired people to go out in different scenes.",70.5,47.5,61.0,77.5,69.5,"[{'path': '2/产品图片-场景图.jpg'}, {'path': '2/展板-视障群体出行需求研究基于_3D_扫描技术的可穿戴产品设-马骋协2110506009.jpg'}, {'path': '2/产品图片-结构图.jpg'}, {'path': '2/产品图片-穿戴效果展示.001.jpeg'}, {'path': '2/产品图片-整体和细节.001.jpeg'}]"
